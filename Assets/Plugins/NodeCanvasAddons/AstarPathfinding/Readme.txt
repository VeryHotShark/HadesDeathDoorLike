A* Pathfinding Actions for NodeCanvas
======================================

Thank you for purchasing this asset, hopefully it will save you a bit of
time on your current project, let us know if there are any other features
you would like to see added or any issues you face while using the actions.

Targeted Versions
=================

- NodeCanvas 3.2.2
- A* Free/Pro 4.2.17

Installation
=============
- Make sure you have added this package with at least the A* Pathfinding folder, you do not NEED the examples
- Make sure you have A* Pathfinding (Aron Granberg) free or pro installed
- Make sure you have NodeCanvas installed

Using Actions & Conditions
==========================
You should now notice that you have a new category in your actions and conditions called A* Pathfinding 
and A* Pathfinding Pro. You can then put the actions into your project and use them rather than 
interacting progmatically.

Using A* Free Version
===========================
If you are using the free version then you will need to enable polyfills or you will get errors
within the project, to enable polyfills go to the "polyfills" folder and  you should see a list
of files within there. The top line will have a commented out bit of code which looks like:

//#define IS_ASTAR_FREE

If you remove the // (uncomment) that line in each polyfill then your actions will work correctly.
This unfortunately is the only way in which we can support both pro and free versions with a
single package.

HELP! I need actions for 3.* version of A* pathfinding
=======================================================

We officially try to keep in line with the latest versions of Aron Granberg's A* products, but we do still provide
the 3.* version actions if you send us an email with your invoice number we can provide you the legacy actions, but
be aware that we only officially support the newer 4.* versions now as 3.* have been deprecated by their creator.
